    """ Extract spike train activity from two-photon scans using CNMF.

    Uses constrained non-negative matrix factorization to find all neurons/components in
    a timeseries of images (locations) and their fluorescence traces (activity) and
    deconvolves them using an autoregressive model of the calcium impulse response
    function. See Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 for details.

    Default values work fine for somatic images.

    :param np.array scan: 3-dimensional scan (image_height, image_width, timesteps).
    :param int num_components: An estimate of neurons/spatial components in the scan FOV.
    :param int merge_threshold: Maximum temporal correlation allowed between activity of
            overlapping components before merging them.
    :param int num_background_components:  Number of background components to use.
    :param bool init_on_patches: If True, run the initialization methods on small patches
            of the scan rather than on the whole image.
    :param int num_processes: How many processes to run in parallel. None for as many
            processes as available cores.
    :param int num_pixels_per_process: How many pixels will a process handle each time.
    :param int block_size: 'number of pixels to process at the same time for dot product.'
    :param string init_method: Initialization method for the components.
        'greedy_roi':Look for a gaussian-shaped patch, apply rank-1 NMF, store components,
            calculate residual scan and repeat for num_components.
        'sparse_nmf': Regularized non-negative matrix factorization (as impl. in sklearn)
    :param int AR_order: Order of the autoregressive process used to model the impulse
        response function, e.g., 0 = no modelling; 2 = model rise plus exponential decay.
    :param (float, float) soma_radius_in_pixels: Estimated neuron radius in the scan in
            the y_axis (height) and x_axis (width). Used in'greedy_roi' initialization to 
            define the size of the gaussian window.
    :param int snmf_alpha: Regularization parameter (alpha) for the sparse NMF (if used).
    :param int patch_downsampling_factor: Division to the image dimensions to obtain patch
        dimensions, e.g., if original size is 256 and factor is 10, patches will be 26x26
    :param int percentage_of_patch_overlap: Patches are sampled in a sliding window. This
        controls how much overlap is between adjacent patches (0 for none, 0.9 for 90%)

    :returns Location matrix (image_height x image_width x num_components). Inferred
            location of each component.
    :returns Activity matrix (num_components x timesteps). Inferred fluorescence traces
            (spike train convolved with the fitted impulse response function).
    :returns: Inferred location matrix for background components (image_height x
            image_width x num_background_components).
    :returns: Inferred activity matrix for background components (image_height x
            image_width x num_background_components).
    :returns: Raw fluorescence traces (num_components x timesteps) obtained from the scan
            minus activity from background and other components.
    :returns: Spike matrix (num_components x timesteps). Deconvolved spike activity.
    :returns: Params (num_components x AR_order) for the autoregressive process used to
            model the calcium impulse response of each component:
                   c(t) = c(t-1) * AR_params[0] + c(t-2) * AR_params[1] + ...

    ..note:: Based on code provided by Andrea Giovanucci.
    ..note:: The produced number of components is not exactly what you ask for because
            some components will be merged or deleted.
    ..warning:: Computation- and memory-intensive for big scans.
